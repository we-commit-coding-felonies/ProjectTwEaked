This is a fork of projectE with the aim of code modification for inclusion in [MagiTekkit](https://github.com/we-commit-coding-felonies/magitekkit), because crafttweaker just isnt quite up to the task.

Here is a list of changes:
 - Gem of Eternal Density can only create up to dark matter, Void Ring can still make red matter
 - Make the transmutation table/tablet ui less horrid (shamelessly stolen and slightly modified from [ProjectEX](https://github.com/latvian-dev/ProjectEX))
 - Archangels smite now applies random potion effects to entities (the effects it applies are configurable, too!)
 - Configurable collector / relay values
   - Stuff like EMC/s, EMC transfer rate, etc.
   - Also a MK0 and MK4 collector/relay, both configurable
 - Keybind to open alchemical bag / transmutation tablet (default B / N respectively)
 - More items are now baubles
   - Klein star (body slot)
   - Transmutation tablet (head slot)
   - Mind stone (head slot)
   - Alchemical bag (belt slot)
 - Super Philosopher's Stone
   - Craft with any item to duplicate it!
   - Performs all normal philosophers stone functions, but for free!
   - Allows you to use your tablet EMC like a Klein Star!
   - Can be worn as a bauble in the charm slot!
   - Is not balanced at all!
 - Bugfixes
   - Matter tools 'oredict radius mining' (eg matter axe aoe tree harvest) no longer fail when water is nearby
   - Subtitles have been localized (incomplete! please help if you can.)
   - Energy Collector progress bars now work properly
